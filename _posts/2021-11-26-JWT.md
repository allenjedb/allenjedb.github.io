<p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.</p>

## JWT

- HEADER, PAYLOAD, SIGNATURE **_Decode from base64_**

- Try setting ALG to none then remove signature but leave the last `.`

- If you have the public key and the token is using RS256 > change to HS256 **_Script in /etc_**

- If there's a Key ID or KID in the Header part - test for SQLi or Directory Traversal. `"kid":"../../../../dev/null"` **_this will sign the token with dev/null which is empty_**

- Sometimes the output is not in quotes try to add quotes ex output: `{"user":admin}` make it `{"user":"admin"}` before encoding to base64 **_Edit: looks like this only applies in scripting, if done in jwt.io do not add quotes. still need to confirm_**

- try to replace kid value with command execution see Hacktricks link

- From pentesterlab `{"typ": "JWT", "alg": "HS256", "kid": "|<command>"}` **_CVE-2017-17405 impacting Ruby Net::FTP_**
- bruteforce jwt secret using john `john jwt.token --wordlist=wordlist.txt --format=HMAC-SHA256`

- SQLi in jwt see Hacktricks link. `' UNION SELECT 'ATTACKER';-- -` then set the secret to `ATTACKER`

- Sometimes they don't even verify the signature, so just try changing the user to admin.
