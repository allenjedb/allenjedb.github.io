<p>Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students to teach/learn web application security in a class room environment.</p>

<p>Let's test our OWASP TOP 10 skills with DVWA</p>

<h1>Bruteforcing</h1>
<p>Low</p>

<p>In the Bruteforcing section we can see a normal login page<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/1.png" alt="" />we can try entering any cred and see how it will react, let's try admin:admin<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/1.png" alt="" />it gives out an error message "Username and/or password incorrect."</p>

<p>Now let's capture the request with a tool called <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload">BurpSuite</a>- BurpSuite is a proxy-based tool used to evaluate the security of web-based applications and do hands-on testing. </p>
