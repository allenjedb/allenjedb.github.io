<p>Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students to teach/learn web application security in a class room environment.</p>

<p>Let's test our OWASP TOP 10 skills with DVWA</p>

<h1>Bruteforcing</h1>
<p>Low</p>

<p>In the Bruteforcing section we can see a normal login page<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/1.png" alt="" />we can try entering any cred and see how it will react, let's try admin:admin<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/1-2.png" alt="" />it gives out an error message "Username and/or password incorrect."</p>

<p>Now let's capture the request with a tool called <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload">BurpSuite</a>- BurpSuite is a proxy-based tool used to evaluate the security of web-based applications and do hands-on testing. </p>

<p>Before we continue using BurpSuite we need to setup our web browser's proxy so that BurpSuite can intercept all the request that we want. For this we will use an add-on called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/">FoxyProxy</a> to make changing our proxy settings easier. Now add a proxy settings with in FoxyProxy as follows <img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/1-3.png" alt="" /> - Select the proxy that you created and now we're ready to intercept our first request!</p>

<p>Login again using any creds - this time Burp will intercept the request and you should see the request in the Proxy tab<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/2.png" alt="" /> - here we can see that we sent a GET request for /vulnerabilities/brute/?username=admi&password=admin&Login=Login to our DVWA host which is 192.168.56.103 on my case.</p>

<p>We can Bruteforce this using the Intruder function of Burp - right click on the request and send the request to Intruder<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/3.png" alt="" /><br>Now that we're in the intruder click the clear button to remove the highlighted payloads - these payloads are the ones that we can bruteforce for this example we will use the Attack Type called Sniper. Highlight the password and click add$.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/4.png" alt="" />You will notice that the password part will get highlighted this means that it is selected for bruteforcing - now click the payloads tab<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/5.png" alt="" />Here we can load out our wordlists that Burp will use to bruteforce our selected payload, in our case the password section.</p>

<p>I will use the worldlist probable-v2-top1575 from the <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists"> Seclists</a> collection. After loading the wordlist we can now proceed to bruteforcing - Click Attack <br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/6.png" alt="" /></p>
